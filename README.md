# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Using Coursera's project network I created a natural language processing project that gauged customer sentiment for Amazon's Echo.
My goal for this project was to build, train, test and deploy an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict sentiment from real Amazon Echo customer reviews.
The tools I used for this project were: Anaconda, Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
This task was accomplished using Rhyme Softworks in my browser.
For this project I created a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization.   
I was also tasked with building a Naive Bayes classifier and assesing its performance.
